# TimeText

TimeText seeks to reduce the stress involved in setting an appointment/activity reminder by drastically simplifying the process and keeping only the fields that are absolutely necessary.

This program also allows the user to send an appointment/activity reminder to another individual.

## Problem Statement

Average Americans are busy and overworked, hustling from place to place. They set reminders (on their smart devices, in particular) for appointments that they don’t want to forget about. They might even see these reminders, but take no notice of them or unintentionally “dismiss” them, regarding them as standard email/other miscellaneous app notifications. 

Or they may not even set reminders in the first place due to the endless number of fields/selections that one can populate/use when creating a reminder or calendar event, such as: 
start time, end time, location, recurring alerts, priority (low, medium, high), travel time, invitees, “Show As” status, work/home calendar selection, and notes.


## Usage  

Currently only works hourly, due to limitations of lambda system.  
Fields:  
Message - Containing the description/purpose of reminder  
Cell phone number - the SMS number to which the reminder is being sent*  
Date of reminder - the day on which the reminder text should be sent  
Hour of reminder - with AM/PM selection
